# Obsidian Notes
Repository for syncing my personal notes made with `Obsidian`.

Notes follow P.A.R.A system. Trying to keep folders fairly shallow, only up to 2 levels (ex. Projects --> Folder 1 --> Notes).

## Note Sections
Deeper dive into what is placed in each folder of the P.A.R.A system.

### 1. Projects
- Short term goals that can be finished within a reasonable amount of time
	- *Example: Individual LeetCode questions while they are being worked.*

### 2. Areas
- Long term goals that can have no definite deadline
	- *Example: Learning Python, Completing all LeetCode Easy Questions*

### 3. Resources
- General knowledge learned while working on notes under **Projects** and **Areas**.
	- *Example: Programming topics such as data structures learned while working LeetCode questions.*

### 4. Archive
- Completed notes in **Projects** and **Areas** that do not fall in Resources end up here.
