# RSS Feed Reader
## Introduction

Let's build an RSS feed reader! Most news websites, blogs, podcasts, maintain a RSS feed which gives real-time content updates. You'll build a tool for fetching and converting the feed with a given RSS feed URL. If you aren't familiar with RSS, here's a great introduction to [how RSS feeds work](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/).

## Requirements

-   The user can input a RSS feed URL.
-   The reader will display the title, description, and link of the original content.

**For an extra challenge**

-   The user can add more than one RSS feed URL.
-   Instead of using a RSS parser library, build the parser yourself!

## Suggested Implementation

If you only want to practice working with RSS, you can implement this project in the terminal.

-   Wrap the code as a script
-   Get the input feed URL from console
-   Show the content in plain text

To get some additional practice with front-end development, you can [work on this project instead](https://www.codementor.io/projects/rss-feed-reader-website-atx32j280x) to create a web page to display the parsed feed content.
